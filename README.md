### Context
This is an experimental project to combine Unity3D based on .NET/C# with Tensorflow based on Python to demonstrate
basic AI and machine learning concepts.  More specifically, a variant of deep learning known as reinforcment learning (RL) using an algorithm approach known as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

I found this by accident but was inspired to help teach my son (NLA) about the intersection of what is possible in game development and how AI may relate.

### Learning Objectives
- Learn Unity3D relates to AI approaches
- Learn more about RL from a different perspective (and not just from stock MOOC content, 2D based Python/Scala notebooks).
- Pair with NLA and have fun

### Eureka! Moment
- Train the model outside of Unity3D, apply into runtime agent with Unity3D, watch in learn... amazing.
