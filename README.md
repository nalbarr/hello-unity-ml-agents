### Context
This is an experimental project to combine Unity3D based on .NET/C# with Tensorflow based on Python to demonstrate
basic AI and machine learning concepts.  More specifically, a variant of deep learning known as reinforcment learning (RL) using an algorithm approach known as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

I found this by accident but was inspired to help teach my son (NLA) about the intersection of what is possible in game development and how AI may relate.

### Learning Objectives
- Learn Unity3D relates to AI approaches
- Learn more about RL from a different perspective (and not just from stock MOOC content, 2D based Python/Scala notebooks).
- Pair with NLA, experiment, co-create and have some fun.

### Eureka! Moment
*If you plan to only scan this repository*
- Train the model outside of Unity3D, apply into runtime agent with Unity3D, watch and see and embedded Unity3D agent improve overally performance using a RL model.  K-12 learners are way more engaged in games, gameficiation, formal "research notebook" learning as learning is not so linear and allows for closed loop experimentation.

### Key Takeaways
- There are pragmatic ways to integrating AI using polygot language/frameworks across ecosystem systems.  Although vendor marketing and toy projects will always "sell it" that way, this project was fun to roll up the sleeves and experiment.
- AI is in major hype cycle.  Most of the MOOCs have already covered machine learning (ML) and now deep learning (DL) of which more complex variants such as reinforcement learning (RL) are now getting more attention.  Although Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, raw RL content they are semester intensive and require some foundational concepts prior to experimenting and actually learning something novel.  For working professionals, I suggest Coursera specializations for Machine Learning, and Deep Learning respectively.  I used this approach to understand RL nuances more deeply since I am a very visual learner.  Also, hacking Unity3D gets you out of a Python/Scala notebook comfort zone.
- Unity3D community really leverages .NET/C# ecosystem.  Although there is some feature lag between what Unity3D supports fully, it is clear they are trending towards the strategic Microsoft direction of leaning out to .NET Framework and fully embracing Linux and open source ecosystem.  It offers 3D visualization that goes beyond traditional or modern web development stacks (e.g., Spring Boot/Java 8/Scala, Nodejs/Javascript, Django/Python, Rails/Ruby, etc.) where 2D rendering is limited with other possibilities such as three.js.
