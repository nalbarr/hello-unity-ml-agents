### Context
This is an experimental project to combine Unity3D based on .NET/C# with Tensorflow based on Python to demonstrate
basic AI and machine learning concepts.  More specifically, a variant of deep learning known as reinforcment learning (RL) using an algorithm approach known as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

I found this by accident but was inspired to help teach my son (NLA) about the intersection of what is possible in game development and how AI may relate.

### Learning Objectives
- Learn Unity3D relates to AI approaches
- Learn more about RL from a different perspective (and not just from stock MOOC content, 2D based Python/Scala notebooks).
- Pair with NLA, experiment, co-create and have some fun.

### Eureka! Moment
*If you plan to only scan this repository*
- Train the model outside of Unity3D, apply into runtime agent with Unity3D, watch and see and embedded Unity3D agent improve overally performance using a RL model.  K-12 learners are way more engaged in games, gameficiation, formal "research notebook" learning as learning is not so linear and allows for closed loop experimentation.

### Key Takeaways
- There are pragmatics ways to integration AI using polygot language/frameworks across ecosystem systems.  Although the general market will "sell it" that way, you just have to roll up the sleeves and experiment.
- Most MOOCs are catching up with consolidating and digesting RL for the main stream.  Although Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, etc. have released those a while ago, you need some foundational learning prior to maximize.  I suggested the Coursera specializations for Machine Learning, and Deep Learning respectively for working professionals.  I used to this to force myself to understand RL nuances since I am a very visual learner and hacking Unity3D gets you out of a Python/Scala notebook comfort zone.
- Unity3D community really leverages .NET/C# ecosystem.  However, there seems to be the usually lag between what is available on Unity3D from a full .NET Framework versus the more strategic Microsoft direction of leaning out to .NET Core and embracing Linux ecosystem as a primary target to compete with other full open source development stacks (e.g., Spring Boot/Java 8/Scala, Nodejs/Javascript, Django/Python, Rails/Ruby, etc.)
